## Switchover

Switchover is a Software-As-A-Service for managing feature toggles (aka switches, flags or feature flips) in your application. Use it for Continous Integration, Continous Delivery, A/B-Testing, Canary Releases, Experementing and everything else you can think of.

__Note:__
This is the core module for other js-related SDKs
